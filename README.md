##Project Summary: Covid Deaths and Vaccinations Exploration Using SQL

In this comprehensive SQL analysis of global COVID-19 data, several key aspects were explored. Firstly, the project assessed the relationship between total cases and deaths in each country, providing valuable insights into the pandemic's severity. Additionally, the examination of total cases against population yielded infection percentages, with notable examples like Andorra and Montenegro leading in infection rates. The project also delved into countries with the highest death counts, identifying the USA as the primary hotspot and India ranking fourth. Continent-wise, Europe had the highest death toll. Finally, the analysis extended to comparing total vaccinations to deaths in each country, with results stored in views for future visualizations, offering a comprehensive perspective on the pandemic's impact.

##Project Summary: Data Ceaning Portfolio Project (NashVilleHousing) Using SQL

This SQL data cleaning project for Nashville housing involved standardizing date formats, removing time from dates, populating missing property addresses through self-joins, handling null values with ISNULL, breaking down addresses into individual components, extracting city and state from OwnerAddress, normalizing "Sold as Vacant" entries, and removing duplicates. The meticulous process aimed to ensure data uniformity, completeness, and accuracy, ultimately enhancing the dataset for more reliable analysis and reporting.

##Project Summary: Excel Project (Bike Sales)

Embarking on a BIKE DATASET project, I meticulously refined the data for robust analysis. I safeguarded the original dataset by creating a duplicate sheet, removed duplicates, and standardized marital status and gender through 'Find and Replace.' I enhanced readability by formatting income to currency and introduced age brackets for demographic insights. Leveraging pivot tables, I delved into data analysis and synthesized compelling visualizations. This process ensures the integrity of the BIKE DATASET while providing stakeholders with actionable insights through clear and organized data representation.
