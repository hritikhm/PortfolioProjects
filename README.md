Project Summary: Covid Deaths and Vaccinations Exploration Using SQL

In this comprehensive SQL analysis of global COVID-19 data, several key aspects were explored. Firstly, the project assessed the relationship between total cases and deaths in each country, providing valuable insights into the pandemic's severity. Additionally, the examination of total cases against population yielded infection percentages, with notable examples like Andorra and Montenegro leading in infection rates. The project also delved into countries with the highest death counts, identifying the USA as the primary hotspot and India ranking fourth. Continent-wise, Europe had the highest death toll. Finally, the analysis extended to comparing total vaccinations to deaths in each country, with results stored in views for future visualizations, offering a comprehensive perspective on the pandemic's impact.
