The project also delved into countries with the highest death counts, identifying the USA as the primary hotspot and India ranking fourth. Continent-wise, Europe had the highest death toll. Finally, the analysis extended to comparing total vaccinations to deaths in each country, with results stored in views for future visualizations, offering a comprehensive perspective on the pandemic's impact.
